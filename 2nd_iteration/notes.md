# Notes
## Second Iteration: Implementing Behavior for Managed Business Objects
In this iteration, we implement the behavior for our business object, enabling transactional operations such as **Create**, **Update**, and **Delete** (CUD). This also involves defining behavior in the **Behavior Definition (BDEF)** and implementing logic in the corresponding **ABAP class**.

---

### Key Objectives:
1. Enable standard transactional operations (**Create**, **Update**, and **Delete**) for the business object.
2. Define **determinations** and **validations** to ensure data consistency.
3. Add logic for actions and associations to the **Behavior Implementation Class**.
4. Activate and test the behavior in the Fiori UI.

---

### Steps:
1. **[Define the Behavior Definition (BDEF)](./06_behavior_implementation.md#z##_i_product_)**:
   - Define the behavior of the business object as **Managed**.
   - Generate class implementation using **Quick Fix** in **ADT**.

2. **[Project the Behavior Definition (BDEF)](./06_behavior_implementation.md#z##_c_product_)**:
   - Define the projection behavior of the business object as **Managed**.

3. **Test the Behavior**:
   - Test the implemented behavior in the Fiori application or using the ABAP console.
   - Verify that the operations (Create, Update, Delete) and validations/determinations function as expected.

---

### Final Steps:
- Activate all new and updated objects (BDEF, ABAP class, and associations).
- Test the Fiori application to ensure the behavior implementation works correctly.

---

### Possible Issues and Solutions:
#### 1. **Problem with transactional behavior**
   **Problem**:
   - The application remains read-only, and the **Create** and **Delete** buttons are not visible.
   **Solution**:
   - Verify the syntax and ensure all required objects (Interface BDEF, Projection BDEF, Implementation Class) are defined correctly and activated without errors.

---

### Summary:
This iteration adds transactional capabilities to the business object by implementing behavior definitions and logic. At the end of this iteration, the application will support **Create**, **Update**, and **Delete** operations.
