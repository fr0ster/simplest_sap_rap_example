# Notes
## Second Iteration: Implementing Behavior for Managed Business Objects
In this iteration, we implement the behavior for our business object, enabling transactional operations such as **Create**, **Update**, and **Delete** (CUD). This also involves defining behavior in the **Behavior Definition (BDEF)** and implementing logic in the corresponding **ABAP class**.

---
### Key Objectives:
1. Enable standard transactional operations (**Create**, **Update**, and **Delete**) for the business object.
2. Define **determinations** and **validations** to ensure data consistency.
3. Add logic for actions and associations to the **Behavior Implementation Class**.
4. Activate and test the behavior in the Fiori UI.
---
### Steps:
1. **[Define the Behavior Definition (BDEF)](./06_behavior_implementation.md)**:
  - Define the behavior of the business object as **Managed**.
  - Enable standard transactional operations.
  - Refer to [06_behavior_implementation.md](./06_behavior_implementation.md) for details.
  - Generate class implementation over **Quick Fix** in **ADT**.
2. **Test the Behavior**:
  - Test the implemented behavior in the Fiori application or using the ABAP console.
  - Verify that the operations (Create, Update, Delete) and validations/determinations function as expected.
---
### Final Steps:
- Activate all new and updated objects (BDEF, ABAP class, and associations).
- Test the Fiori application to ensure the behavior implementation works correctly.
---
### Possible Issues and Solutions:
#### 1. **Errors in Behavior Definition Activation**
  **Problem**:
  - Errors occur when activating the Behavior Definition (BDEF).
  **Solution**:
  - Check the syntax and ensure all required elements (actions, determinations, validations) are defined correctly.
  - Refer to [00_behavior_definition.md](./00_behavior_definition.md) for troubleshooting tips.
#### 2. **Issues with Determinations or Validations**
  **Problem**:
  - Determinations or validations are not triggered as expected.
  **Solution**:
  - Verify that the logic is correctly implemented in the Behavior Implementation Class.
  - Ensure that the triggering conditions are properly configured in the BDEF.
  - Refer to [01_behavior_implementation.md](./01_behavior_implementation.md) for debugging tips.
---
### Summary:
This iteration adds transactional capabilities to the business object by implementing behavior definitions and logic. At the end of this iteration, the application will support **Create**, **Update**, and **Delete** operations, as well as custom determinations and validations.
